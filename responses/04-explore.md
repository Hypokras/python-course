Though you've completed this course, there's plenty more to learn. You can even use this program as a place to start.

Here are some ideas for next steps:

- [ ] Add some more quotes to your text file
- [ ] Print out more than one quote at a time
- [ ] Remove that extra line (called a newline) when printing
- [ ] Learn about file writing and add quotes programmatically

Give one or more of those a shot, then when you're really ready to move on, **close this issue**.
