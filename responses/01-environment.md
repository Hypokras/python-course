Before we can start writing Python, we need to make sure you have your environment set up. You just need a few things (some of which you might already have!)

- [ ] Check that Python is installed
- [ ] Check that Git is installed
- [ ] Clone this repository on your local machine

---

## Check that Python is installed

Your machine may already have Python, or you might need to install it. To find out, go to your command line terminal and type: `python -V`

If you see your Python version displayed, you’re all set. Otherwise, you’ll need to [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system.

## Check that Git is installed

We’ll use a similar approach to find out if you already have git installed. From your comment line, type: `git --version`

If you see your Git version displayed, you’re good to go. Otherwise, you’ll need to [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system.

## Clone this repository on your local machine

Now we’re getting to the fun stuff. Let’s clone this repository to your local machine so that we can make some edits:
`git clone {{ repoUrl }}.git`

You can also download or clone the repo via SSH from the [main repo page]({{ repoUrl }}).

## Close this issue to continue

With your environment ready, let’s get started.
