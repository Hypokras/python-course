Great! That's the first line. Now, how would we print the last line?

You'll want to edit `[0]` to include the index of the last value in the array. You can check out [quotes.txt]({{ repoUrl }}blob/master/quotes.txt) to see the number of lines.

Since the first value is the _zeroth_, you'll need to remove one from the number you include for the last value.

## Comment with the last quote

Run your code using `python get-quote.py` and copy the value to your clipboard.

Paste the quote as a comment here and I'll follow up with next steps!
